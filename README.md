## Overview
This is the simulation of the intermediate circuit of the inverter Bamocar D3.
The simulation want to study the problem of over-request of current to the inverter from Fenice-evo.
After the simulation with all the capacities and inductors, it will show if the dc-link cap extension resolves the problem or not

## Inverter problem
The inverter has the problem that it requires a large amount of current (and this is ok), but it power off after a little time.
TODO: check the thermal isolation, there is the probability that the inverter sensor power off the system if the temperature grow up too much.

## Simulation
The schematic is the DC-link schematic, with and approsimation of all the capacities and inductors.
