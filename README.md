## Overview
This is the simulation of the intermediate circuit of the inverter Bamocar D3.
The simulation want to study the problem of over-request of current to the inverter from Fenice-evo.
After the simulation with all the capacities and inductors, it will show if the dc-link cap extension resolves the problem or not
